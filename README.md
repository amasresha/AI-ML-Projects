# AI/ML Projects

Welcome to my collection of AI and ML projects! This repository is a central hub for some of my work in artificial intelligence and machine learning across various industries.

## Projects

- **[Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/amasresha/Bank_Churn_Prediction)**
  Predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. This project aims to identify customers who are likely to leave the bank in the near future.
  
- **[Plant Seedlings Classification](https://github.com/amasresha/Plant-Seedlings-Classification)**
  Develop an image-based classifier to accurately identify and categorize plant seedlings into 12 distinct species.
  
- **[AllLife-Bank-Personal-Loan-Campaign](https://github.com/amasresha/AllLife-Bank-Personal-Loan-Campaign)**
  Predict which liability customers are likely to purchase personal loans, identify the key customer attributes influencing these decisions, and target the most promising customer segments.
  
- **[Credit-Card-Users-Churn-Prediction](https://github.com/amasresha/Credit-Card-Users-Churn-Prediction)**
  Predict which customers are likely to stop using their credit cards and identify the key factors contributing to churn, enabling Thera Bank to take proactive measures to retain customers.
  
-  **[NLP-Stock-Market-News-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Summarization](https://github.com/amasresha/NLP-Stock-Market-News-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Summarization))**
  Develop an AI system to analyze stock news, gauge market sentiment, and provide weekly insights to enhance stock predictions and investment strategies.

-  **[FoodHub-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/amasresha/FoodHub-Data-Analysis))**
 Analyze FoodHub's order data to improve customer experience and optimize business strategies.

-  **[Huggingface-MLops-Text-Summarization](https://github.com/amasresha/huggingface-mlops-summarization)**
 This project demonstrates an MLOps pipeline for text summarization using Hugging Face Transformers, Gradio, and GitHub Actions. The application allows users to input text and receive a summarized version using a pre-trained Hugging Face model. The pipeline is automated using GitHub Actions to sync the application with a Hugging Face Space.

-  **[MLops-GitHub-Actions](https://github.com/amasresha/MLops-GitHub-Actions)**
 A project demonstrating an MLOps pipeline using GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

-  **[MLops-Automation](https://github.com/amasresha/mlops-automation)**
 MLOps pipeline demonstrating Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for a machine learning application.

-  **[Enterprise-Policy-AI-Chatbot-RAG-Powered-QA-System-with-LangChain-Agents-LLM-Optimization](https://github.com/amasresha/Enterprise-Policy-AI-Chatbot-RAG-Powered-QA-System-with-LangChain-Agents-LLM-Optimization)**
 A document intelligence assistant that uses RAG architecture with LangChain agents to analyze, query, and summarize any provided text documents through conversational interactions.
